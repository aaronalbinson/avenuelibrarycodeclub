      Every 2 weeks children from ages 9 - 13 get together at Avenue Library in
      Moston to make some awesome things with code. Games, puzzles, websites,
      you name it we make it. We have a lot of fun working and learning
      together. 


      We learn coding with the help of the follow technology: 


      * Scratch

      * Raspberry Pi

      * Microbit

      * Python

      * HTML/CSS (websites)


      Each lesson is led by our volunteers who guide the children through the
      code club projects or a devised project created by our club leader.


      We regularly join in with the code club network competitions, which are
      really challenging and fun.


      At the end of each session we show/play each others work to see how
      other's have created their projects.

      ## Our Projects


      We love sharing some of the projects we've been working on and you can
      even have a go at your club with our tutorials. Each one of our projects
      has a badge at the end that the children collect.
