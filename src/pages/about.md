      Every 2 weeks children from ages 9 - 13 get together at Avenue Library in
      Moston to make some awesome things with code. Games, puzzles, websites,
      you name it we make it. We have a lot of fun working together.

      * Scratch

      * Raspberry Pi

      * Microbit

      * Python

      * HTML/CSS (websites)

      ## Our Projects


      We love sharing some of the projects we've been working on and you can
      even have a go at your club with our tutorials. Each one of our projects
      has a badge at the end that the children collect.
