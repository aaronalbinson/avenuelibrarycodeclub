      ## Introduction


      In this project you will learn how to make a game. The objective of the
      game is to reach from the bottom to the top of the screen without getting
      caught by any moving objects.

      ## Step 1: Sprites and background


      First, open up the Scratch editor. You can find the online Scratch editor
      at [jumpto.cc/scratch-new](jumpto.cc/scratch-new).


      Choose your character from the sprites and a background for your game.


      Now program your sprite/character to move up, left and right. We don't
      want our character to move down, since that would make the game too easy.
